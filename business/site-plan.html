      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>Welcome to TodoBarranca Website!</p>  <!-- change this -->
      <p>Are you looking for reasonable prices? You are in the best place. 
        The purpose of this website is to expand sales and not be limited 
        to the physical, looking for new paths in virtuality. 
        At TodoBarranca you can buy everything you need for devices to work well, 
        from mice, cables and adapters to graphics cards, cameras and cases. 
        We seek to satisfy the great needs that people have when owning devices, 
        as these usually require different components, cables, adapters, etc. 
        Don't worry, here you can find everything you need, and at a good price!</p>

      <h3>Audience</h3>
      <p>The technology market is really huge, our audience is focused on those people 
        who have technological devices at home, since each device usually requires another 
        component to function properly. Not only this, but also to cover the great demand 
        that there is and usually people have little capital to afford to buy pieces like 
        these, that is the reason for our prices, to focus mainly on people who receive 
        less money than normal, we even have discounts and promotions for you!</p>  <!-- change this -->

      <h2>
        Content
      </h2>
      <h3>Home page</h3>
      <p>
        On the TodoBarranca website you can find more information about the physical store, what its purpose is, the audience 
        to which it is directed, indications of the physical location and detailed information about the store. It serves more 
        than anything to show general information about the store and to be able to answer general questions from customers who 
        visit the page. Referential images, social networks and contact information will be shown. The main page is in charge 
        of welcoming customers and allowing them to know quickly about what the TodoBarranca store is about and what it offers, 
        that is, its purpose. I seek to make it quite summarized and not tire the client so quickly, with this the selection 
        of colors will also help me, since they were chosen according to the colors that represent the city of Barranca, in 
        the same way the logo. In addition, regarding the actions that the user must do, these will be few, in general it 
        should be shown that this is a page with the purpose of giving general information and leading to other sub-pages 
        with more information, perhaps in the future the function of adding accounts and with it a data store can be added. 
        For this reason, the user will find it easy to navigate and will be able to understand how the page works in a matter 
        of minutes, or at least that is what is sought. The home page will be in charge of opening the way to the other 
        sub-pages, but it will not be left behind either and it will also be used to show other related things quickly.

      </ul>
      <h3>Products</h3>
      <p>
        The products page, as its name says, will focus mainly on showing the types of products sold in the store and
        summary information, you will even be able to see referential images and how the products look so that you 
        have a better idea of what you're buying and if this catches your eye. The products that are most striking, 
        in this way the client will obtain more information and will be able to approach the physical store to buy it. 
        This page will help customers to know more about the content of the store, what will be found, and especially 
        at what price. Anyway, I will look for the most organized way to show the products, because if I really put all 
        of them, it would take longer than expected to make a complete catalog. This is a page that can be loaded with 
        a lot of information, so without a doubt it will be sought to reduce the least amount of text and more images 
        so that the client's attention is called by all the color and graphic material.

      <h3>FAQ</h3>
      <p>
        When it comes to selling products, there will always be doubts that customers will have, which is why this FAQ page is 
        posted, in order to resolve any doubt that a potential customer may have. Among them, they can be questions regarding 
        quality, price, place, contact information, where the products come from, warranty, how reliable they are, etc. This is 
        the reason for the existence of the page, for this reason it will be filled with the largest number of questions, so 
        that we can be able to inform customers and remove any doubts they may have. It will be accompanied by images in the 
        same way, since it is what gives it a more aesthetic touch and helps the client to receive the information more easily. 
        I want to make the FAQ page the one in charge of making it clear why it is necessary to visit this page in order to 
        be well informed about the TodoBarranca store, and that without a doubt it is an opportunity that you cannot miss if 
        you are a person interested in the technology, and at low prices. In the future, an extra function may be added where 
        the customer can enter their own questions, but for now the questions that will be displayed and answered at the same 
        time will be given from our perspective as sellers, trying to understand how the customer would think and what doubts 
        are prone to appear.
